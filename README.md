Weatherface - a Pebble watchface that shows current weather conditions.
=================
PURPOSE
-----------------
The purpose of this project is essentially to satisfy my own curiosity while learning about the Pebble SDK.

DESIGN
----------------
Watchface will include a minimal time display -- probably simply a re-implementation of the standard "Text Watch" face that ships with the device --  as well as some information about the weather. The initial goal is to display the current temperature. Hopefully this will be expanded later on to include other information such as an icon to indicate the current conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc).
