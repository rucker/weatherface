Weatherface - a Pebble watchface that shows current weather conditions.
=================
PURPOSE
-----------------
The purpose of this project is essentially to satisfy my own curiosity while learning about the Pebble SDK.

DESIGN
----------------
Watchface will be a minimal time display -- preferrably only the current time in a format such as 'Nine forty nine' as well as some information about the weather. The initial goal is to display the current temperature. Hopefully this will be expanded later on to include other information such as an icon to indicate the current conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc).

MOCKUP
---------------
A crude mockup can be found below. I am not good with Markdown.
